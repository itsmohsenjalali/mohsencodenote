# What is RDS?
Relational Database Service offer you relational databases that mange by Amazon. This service has some of popular DBMS like PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server and etc.

## Note 
When you scale up your RDS you can't scale it down you should start your plan with the minimum of you required and after that scale your instances.

Multi-AZ feature is one of the RDS feature that create standby RDS instance in same region but in another available zone and you don't get down time. we recommend that start with single instance and in future you can add multi-az if we want.
