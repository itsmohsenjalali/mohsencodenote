# What is S3?
It's Simple Storage Service. this service use for store data on cloud.

# Prepare
We need two bucket of S3. one of them for public content and another one for private content. This is fro security reason.

# Work with S3 with SDK or AWS CLI
we can upload file with AWS CLI or if we want to work with S3 in code we use SDK.

# For Security
Instead use access key for connecting to the S3 service we should use IAM role and assing this role to the ec2.

# S3 file lifecycle 
S3 has several cool feature that we can use it like Glacier for keep old data that we don't use them so much. Glacier is cheaper than normal plan of S3. we should search about `S3 policy`, `file managment` and `S3 service`.
