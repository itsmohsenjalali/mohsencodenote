## What is ORM?
Object Relational Mapping is technique that lets you query and manipulate data from a database, using an object oriented paradigm.

## Pros of ORM
- writing the data model in one place - easier to maintain.
- lots of things done automatically
- no need to write SQL syntax
- database abstraction - you can change the database type whenever you wish.
- leverages OOP therefore things like inheritance are easy to achieve.

## Cons of ORM 
- you have to learn it, and ORM libraries are not always simple
- performance is alright, but it's easy to neglect
- makes it easy to forget (or never learn) 


## Install TypeORM
```Terminal
npm i @nestjs/typeorm typeorm pg
```
